/**

 *
 * --- searchElement --- The value to search for.
 *
 * --- fromIndex --- A fromIndex value greater than or equal to the length of the array also causes the whole array to be searched.A fromIndex value greater than 0 is taken as the offset from the beginning of the array.A fromIndex value less than 0 is taken as the offset from the end of the array â€” in other words, it is taken as specifying the position at array.length + fromIndex. Therefore, if array.length + fromIndex is less than 0, the array is not searched, and the method returns -1.
