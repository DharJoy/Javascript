/** ######################### What is function invoking  #########################
 * * JavaScript Function Invocation is used to executes the function code and it is common to use the term “call a function” instead of “invoke a function”
 *
 *
 * * Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).
